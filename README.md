# Horiseon-refactor

## Description
 
 Cleaned up original code using semantic HTML elements to replace div. I also added alt image and icon descriptions. Combined redundant class layout design to show up under each corresponding section. Added a website descriptive title. Fixed error in code so footer shows up in correct sequential order on webpage. Cleaned up the site for optimal accessibility for usage.
